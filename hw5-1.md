# Homework 5.1: Altair Visualizations

## Plot 1: Bigfoot Reports by State

This visualization I created shows the number of Bigfoot reports for each U.S. state.The x-axis is showing the categorical data, which is each state. The y-axis is showing the count of reported sightings, which is quantitative data. The chart I created uses vertical bars so that it is clear to see the comparisons between different states. Not only this, but using a uniform blue color helps to maintain focus on the information and reduce distractions. Finally, I included a tooltip to display the exact values when hovering over the bar to add further clarity and see the exact data values. No additional cleaning was needed as the state field was already consistent and the counts were obtained through the value_counts method in Python. Finally, this version of the barchart was built using Alatir and added the tooltips as well. Not only this, but instead of a standalone bar char we have built previously, we have also exported it to  a HTML chart.

## Plot 2: Latitude vs. Longitude of Reports (Interactive)

The visual shows the geographic spread of Bigfoot sightings across the U.S. The x-axis shows latitude, which is a quantitative variable. The y-axis shows longitude, which is a quantitative variable. The color used helps to encode the classification of each sighting such as Class A, B, or C. Class A is evident through the blue circles, Class B is evident through the orange circles, and Class C is evident through the red circles. By looking at the counts of each of the classifications in the dataset, it is evident that there are not many Class C sightings; thus, it can not be seen a lot in the chart. The Bigfoot Field Association has defined Class A as reliable visual sightings, Class B as indirect evidence such as noises, and Class C as vague third-party reports. Each point on the chart is one Bigfoot sighting. For interactivity, I used the selection_interval() from Altair to create a brushing tool. This means that the viewer can click and drag to highlight regions in the plot. Only the points highlighted will stay colored by classification, but the others will turn gray. This is done so that the user can focus on specific regions or clusters of the sightings. The color scheme reflects the different classifications and that they can be seen clearly. The interactive brush allows for a deeper dive into the datapoints and clarity. I did basic cleaning such as dropping rows with the missing latitude and longitude. No other complex transformations were needed. This was built using Altair, which is a different way to build the chart.
